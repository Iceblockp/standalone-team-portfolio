# Contact Form Input Background Fix

## Issue

Contact form input fields had brownish/dark background colors that didn't match the overall design aesthetic and looked unprofessional.

## Root Cause

- `AnimatedInput` component was using `bg-background` which resolves to brownish colors
- Textarea in contact form was also using `bg-background`
- No proper dark mode support for input backgrounds
- Border colors weren't optimized for both light and dark themes

## Solutions Applied

### 1. AnimatedInput Component Background

**Before:**

```tsx
"bg-background transition-colors duration-200";
"border-neutral-300 focus:border-primary-500";
```

**After:**

```tsx
"bg-white dark:bg-neutral-800 transition-colors duration-200";
"border-neutral-300 focus:border-primary-500 dark:border-neutral-600 dark:focus:border-primary-400";
```

**Benefits:**

- Light theme: Clean white background for professional appearance
- Dark theme: Proper neutral-800 background that matches the design system
- Better border colors for both themes
- Improved focus states with theme-appropriate colors

### 2. Contact Form Textarea

**Before:**

```tsx
"bg-background transition-colors duration-200";
"border-neutral-300 focus:border-primary-500";
```

**After:**

```tsx
"bg-white dark:bg-neutral-800 transition-colors duration-200";
"border-neutral-300 focus:border-primary-500 dark:border-neutral-600 dark:focus:border-primary-400";
```

**Benefits:**

- Consistent styling with other form inputs
- Professional white background in light theme
- Proper dark theme support
- Better visual hierarchy and readability

### 3. Code Cleanup

- Removed unused imports: `MessageCircle`, `Calendar`, `Globe`, `ArrowRight`
- Cleaner component code without unused dependencies

## Visual Improvements

- **Light Theme**: Clean white input backgrounds for professional appearance
- **Dark Theme**: Consistent neutral-800 backgrounds that blend well with the design
- **Focus States**: Proper primary color highlights in both themes
- **Border Consistency**: Theme-appropriate border colors for better visual hierarchy

## Accessibility Improvements

- Better contrast ratios between text and input backgrounds
- Consistent focus indicators across all form elements
- Improved readability for users with visual impairments
- Better visual feedback for form interactions

## Testing Recommendations

- Test form inputs in both light and dark themes
- Verify focus states work properly in both themes
- Test form submission with various input combinations
- Validate accessibility with screen readers
- Test on various devices and screen sizes

## Files Modified

- `components/animations/micro-interactions.tsx` - AnimatedInput component background fix
- `components/site/sections/contact.tsx` - Textarea background fix and code cleanup
